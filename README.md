1. Select your console
2. Game Name
3. Give it a description of the codes
4. Type the codes (You can grab the codes from [CodeTwink](http://www.codetwink.com/); they have the best selections)
5. Once you click add; it'll show you how the code looks like in text format. IT DOES NOT save the file.
6. As I mentioned above.
7. You will need to browse and locate a cht file first before you can use this option.
8. If you like what you see, this will save it in cht format. If you already have the same name; it will update the file instead of as new.
9. You'll only use this if you want to import it to see how the cht file looks like.

F.A.Q.s
1. Where do we place these files?
A. Retroarch is not like other emulators where the name needs to be the same. You can pretty much put it anywhere you want within the emulator folder as long as you know where to locate it.

2. Does this works on other emulators?
A. Haven't tried, but highly doubt it.

3. Will you be updating this program?
A. Maybe. Busy with life so I'll update once in the blue moon.

4. Since it's open-source, can we do what we want with the files and distribute them?
A. Make sure to credit me.
